'''
Introduction:

This program analyzes data and provides basic security for a NASA fan-site. There are 4 major features.

Feature 1: List the top 10 most active host/IP addresses that have accessed the site.

Feature 2: Identify the 10 resources that consume the most bandwidth on the site.

Feature 3: List the top 10 busiest (or most frequently visited) 60-minute periods.

Feature 4: Detect patterns of three failed login attempts from the same IP address over 20 seconds so that all further
attempts to the site can be blocked for 5 minutes. Log those possible security breaches.

The program is organized as follows:
1. Data and Initialization
2. Functions
3. Main Program
'''

'''Data and Initialization'''

## Import modules, data from files, and create variables and data structures that will be used in the main program.


# The datetime module allows for arithmetic with dates, which will prove useful for features 3 and 4.
import datetime

import sys

# Establish filepaths for the input (log.txt) an output files (hours.txt, hosts.txt, blocked.txt, and resources.txt).
logPath = sys.argv[1]
hostsPath = sys.argv[2]
hoursPath = sys.argv[3]
resourcesPath = sys.argv[4]
blockedPath = sys.argv[5]

# Open output files for writing in the main program.
hoursFile = open(hoursPath, 'w')
hostsFile = open(hostsPath, 'w')
blockedFile = open(blockedPath, 'w')
resourcesFile = open(resourcesPath, 'w')

# Data description:
# Each line of log.txt is one long string. After splitting a line, we obtain a list of strings. Here is what each
# position in the list represents in the data.

'''
Index 0: 'host'
Index 1: '-'
Index 2: '-'
Index 3: '[DD/Mon/YYYY:HH:MM:SS' (need to splice to get rid of leading bracket)
Index 4: '-0400]' (need to splice to get rid of ending bracket)
Index 5: '"POST' or '"GET'
Index 6: 'resource' (login, load site, etc)
Index 7: 'HTTP/1.0"' (this index is sometimes omitted and I'm not sure why)
Index 8: 'reply code'
Index 9: 'bytes' in reply (where '-' means 0)

# divides 3600.

'''Functions'''

## Define any functions that the main program requires. Calculations that need to be repeated at different points of a
## program should be coded as functions.
